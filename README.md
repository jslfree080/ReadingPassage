## Fleming's discovery of penicillin
In 1928, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming observed that a blue mold had invaded one of his samples of bacteria. He almost discarded it, but then he noticed that the area contaminated by the mold was surrounded by a zone where bacteria colonies did not grow well. The bacteria were disease organisms of the genus Staphylococcus, which can cause boils and skin infections. Anything that could kill them was valuable. Fleming saved a sample of the mold, but he could do little more. Even though he recognized the potential practical benefit of penicillin, the techniques needed to culture (grow) and process it did not exist yet. In fact, <ins>more than 10 years passed before penicillin was put to significant use</ins>. In 1939, Sir Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain developed chemical procedures to extract, grow, and purify the active agent penicillin from the mold. In recognition of their work, Fleming, Florey, and Chain shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.<br/>

## The fossil of Tiktaalik
Paleontologistsâ€”scientists who research ancient life by studying fossils- long ago established that the first animals to move from the ocean to land must have done so during the Devonian era (419 to 359 million years ago). As these animals moved out of the ocean, they slowly began developing physical features, such as limbs and lungs, suited to the atmospheric and gravitational demands of terrestrial (land-based) life. For years, paleontologists attempted to determine from fossil fragments what the first land-based animals might have looked like.<br/>
