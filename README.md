## Fleming's discovery of penicillin (Biochemistry)
In 1928, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming observed that a blue mold had invaded one of his samples of bacteria. He almost discarded it, but then he noticed that the area contaminated by the mold was surrounded by a zone where bacteria colonies did not grow well. The bacteria were disease organisms of the genus Staphylococcus, which can cause boils and skin infections. Anything that could kill them was valuable. Fleming saved a sample of the mold, but he could do little more. Even though he recognized the potential practical benefit of penicillin, the techniques needed to culture (grow) and process it did not exist yet. In fact, <ins>more than 10 years passed before penicillin was put to significant use</ins>. In 1939, Sir Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain developed chemical procedures to extract, grow, and purify the active agent penicillin from the mold. In recognition of their work, Fleming, Florey, and Chain shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.<br/>

## The fossil of Tiktaalik (Paleontology)
Paleontologistsâ€”scientists who research ancient life by studying fossils- long ago established that the first animals to move from the ocean to land must have done so during the Devonian era (419 to 359 million years ago). As these animals moved out of the ocean, they slowly began developing physical features, such as limbs and lungs, suited to the atmospheric and gravitational demands of terrestrial (land-based) life. For years, paleontologists attempted to determine from fossil fragments what the first land-based animals might have looked like. Then in April 2006, researchers in Canada's Nunavut Territory discovered an amazingly well-preserved and complete skeleton of a creature <ins>that they believe is an important missing link showing how these early land animals probably evolved</ins>.<br/><br/>
The two-foot-long (61 centimeter-long) fossil is of an animal that scientists have named Tiktaalik Roseae, which means "large shallow water fish" in the language of the region's Inuit people. <ins>The creature lived 370 million years ago in what was at that time part of a large, swampy landmass near Earth's equator-this area moved to its current location as a result of shifts in the plates that make up Earth's surface</ins>. At that time, deciduous plants were thriving, periodically shedding their leaves in the water, which attracted small prey into warm swampy shallows that were difficult for larger fish to swim in. Scientists believe that competition for food among fish in the oceans had become intense, leading Tiktaalik and other species to begin exploring opportunities in these swampy regions.<br/>

## Chavin de Huantar (Architecture & Archaeology)
Chavin de Huantar is one of the most celebrated ceremonial centers in the Andes. It is an archaeological site containing ruins and artifacts originally constructed around 900 BC by the Chavin, a pre-Inca culture. Evidence suggests that the site flourished from 850 to 200 BC, making the Chavin society one of the earliest civilizations in South America.<br/><br/>
Located at an elevation of nearly 3,150 meters above sea level, Chavin de Huantar is ringed by high snow-covered mountains in the north-central highlands of Peru. To its west is the Cordillera Blanca, whose glaciated peaks often exceed 5,500 meters, and to its east is another somewhat lower, but equally steep mountain range, the Cordillera Oriental.<br/><br/>
Chavin de Huantar was home to a moderately large agricultural society. The initial settlement was a small ceremonial center surrounded by domestic structures that together made up a vigorous highland community. Its location on a key trade route midway between the Peruvian coast and the lowland tropical forest to the east made Chavin de Huantar a natural trade center. This strategic position allowed the Chavin people to control the region's trade routes, increase the exchange of goods with other people and regions, and import goods that were not natural to the area.<br/><br/>
The Chavin de Huantar site consists of two main structures, the Old Temple and the New Temple. The Old Temple was an inward-facing U-shaped structure with a central court. The court contained obelisks and stone monuments with low relief carvings depicting jaguars, caimans, hawks, and various anthropomorphic forms. The interior of the temple contained a maze of passageways, chambers, and water conduits.<br/><br/>
The New Temple, constructed between 500 and 200 BC, also contained many relief sculptures and was a more block-like form. A massive stair led up to an elevated landing with a sunken rectangular court. Hidden passageways and platforms allowed Chavin priests to miraculously appear above their audiences.<br/><br/>
The site has given its name to the famous Chavin art style of carved stone figures and images, which uses intricate geometrical and curvilinear motifs that combine the features of humans, snakes, jaguars, caimans, birds, and other animals to create strange and fascinating new creatures. The Chavin style used a special carving technique known as contour rivarly, which allows an image or figure to have multiple interpretations, depending on the angle at which it is viewed. Turning or moving the piece causes a new design to emerge.<br/><br/>
Chavin artwork was highly symbolic and made intentionally difficult to interpret. The artwork was used in Chavin religious rituals, and the complex sacred designs were intended to be understood only by high priests of the Chavin cult, who were able to maintain power and authority by keeping the knowledge hidden from the ordinary Chavin people.<br/><br/>
The art and temple architecture of the Chavin de Huantar site continues to attract the attention of Andean archaeologists and other researchers. The site has revealed many details about the lives and rituals of this ancient civilization.<br/>

## Chimpanzee Research: Do Chimpanzees Transmit Culture? (Animal Behavior & Education)
In a recent study, research teams examined chimpanzee populations in Africa. They observed ways that chimpanzees appear to pass behavior from one generation to another. Based on the experiment, the research team asked the question of whether chimpanzees could learn to utilize tools from each other in the same way. Behavior that is learned from others in a population and passed along in this manner is what we call culture. In posing the question of whether chimpanzees can experience culture, the scientists had raised a controversial issue. In the past, most biologists have thought that only humans experienced culture. Although testing this type of learning in the field has been difficult, investigators at Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia, recently performed an experiment <ins>guided by the notion that</ins> chimpanzees can learn particular ways to use tools by observing other chimps. Thus, the controversial hypothesis that chimpanzees can transmit culture was tested.
